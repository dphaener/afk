# Decisions

Choices made while building afk that `docs/PLAN.md` did not make. Newest task last. A later task should read the entry for any task it depends on.

## T0.1

T0.1 seeded this repo from forge-cli and renamed it. These are the decisions the master plan left open.

### Assumptions behind the rename

- **Case.** The name is always lowercase `afk` in prose and on screen, even at the start of a sentence (`afk Dashboard`). Environment variables become `AFK_`. Go and JavaScript identifiers become `Afk` or `afk` as the language needs (`AfkDir`, `afkRepo`).
- **One name.** `forge-cli` became `afk` everywhere it was a marketplace, repo or install name, so the plugin id is `afk@afk` and the install marker file is `.afk-install`.
- **Codename.** The heavy-tier codename `Forgemaster` became `Ironmaster`. It keeps the smithing theme of Spark, Smith and Oracle, and a codename is not a provenance note, so it could not stay.
- **Reworded words.** Words that only contain the letters "forge" (forget, forgets, forgetting, forgery, fire-and-forget) were reworded in comments with the same meaning, so a plain search for the old name finds only real mentions.
- **Allowed mentions.** The old name stays only in `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/provenance.md`, this file, `plugins/afk-opencode/PROVENANCE.md`, the bootstrap comment and `.forge/` line in `.gitignore`, and one provenance sentence each in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Ignored state.** `.gitignore` ignores both `.afk/` and `.forge/`, because tasks before T0.2 still run as forge sessions and their state must never be committed.
- **Test goldens.** Fixtures named after the old project were renamed like everything else. UI golden files were regenerated with `-update` and diffed against the originals: only the renamed text and the padding that follows from its length changed.
- **CI.** One workflow, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, on `ubuntu-26.04`, runs `make check`. `make check` gained `plugin-test` and `hook-test`, so local runs and CI cannot drift apart.
- **What agents did not run.** The checks that need the VM (`afk plugin install --target claude`, `afk new --scratch` opening a pane in `afk dash`) were not run by agents, because they change the owner's real environment. They are owner checks. `afk new --dry-run --base main x` was run against a binary built outside `$PATH`.
- **Tests.** No new tests were added. The existing suites, renamed, were the safety net, with a baseline run recorded before any rename.

### Names the map did not cover

- `FORGE-E2E-OLD` and `FORGE-E2E-RESUMED` test banners became `AFK-E2E-OLD` and `AFK-E2E-RESUMED`.
- The hook shell variable `FORGE_DIR` became `AFK_DIR`, and the hook log variable became `AFK_HOOK_LOG`.
- The notification title `Forge: {plan}` became `afk: {plan}`, and the default session title `forge session` became `afk session`.
- Git test identities and fixtures: the git user `Forge Test` became `afk Test`, and fixture repo paths ending in `forge-cli` became `afk`.
- Plugin ids in fixtures: `forge@claude-marche` and `forge@marche` became `afk@claude-marche` and `afk@marche`. The plugin name changed, the marketplace names did not.
- In the OpenCode port, "Forge Model Registry", "Forge Conductor" and "Forge Orchestrator" became "afk ..." by the display rule, and `non-forge` became `non-afk`.
- `plugins/afk-opencode/PROVENANCE.md` keeps every upstream name, path and SHA as written. A note at the top says so, and only the glossary column that describes this port's own current names was renamed. Its "forge_workflow contract" and Phase 0 sections still show the old tool names on purpose, as the historical record.

### Expectations whose width or order changed

- `afk Dashboard` is 2 cells shorter than the old header badge, so in `internal/ui/emptystate_test.go` the padding literal `strings.Repeat(" ", 25)` became 27 (the header is still padded to width 40), and the truncation case at width 10 now expects `afk Dashb…`.
- In `TestRenderHeaderIsExactlyOneRow` the aggregate-rung width went from 71 to 69 (and the named rung's natural width from 72 to 70), so the test still sits one cell below the rung it is checking. The assertions are unchanged.
- Case-sensitivity fixtures keep mixed case rather than the lowercase display rule, because lowercasing them would erase what they test: `internal/project/project_test.go` uses `Afk` and `afk`, and `internal/provider/provider_test.go` uses `"Afk Plugin\n"`.
- Near-miss name fixtures in `internal/pluginstall/pluginstall_test.go` became `afkish@x` (has the prefix but is not `afk@`) and `partafk@openai-curated-remote` (suffix match). Both must still not be reported.

### Known issues carried forward

- Because the name is lowercase everywhere, some prose in the plugin reads oddly (for example a sentence that starts "afk is a ..."). That is the display rule at work, not a missed rename.

## T0.2

T0.2 grafted shipit's strengths onto the afk plugin and made the task cycle lean (PLAN §5.7). These are the decisions the master plan left open, numbered as in the work plan's assumptions (A1 to A27).

### Not verified, owner check

- **shipit was not readable (A1).** It is not on this machine and the note the session description promised was missing. The QA scenarios (tool, steps, expected, evidence path) and the hands-on QA check were built from the wording of `docs/PLAN.md` T0.2 and §5.7, not from shipit's text.
- **The supervised autonomous run was not done (A14).** T0.2's acceptance asks for one small real task, run in a scratch repo, ending `phase: done` with evidence files, a verdict file and no terminal questions. Agents did not run it, because it installs the plugin into your agent CLI config and spends real usage. Please do it:
  1. `make install`, then `afk plugin install --target claude`.
  2. Make a scratch repo: `git init scratch && cd scratch`, add a small file such as a README, commit it, and give it a `docs/PLAN.md` holding one tiny task.
  3. Run `afk new --autonomous --description "Implement T1.1 from docs/PLAN.md" t1-1` and leave it alone.
  4. When it finishes, check that `.afk/t1-1/status.json` says `"phase": "done"`, that `.afk/t1-1/evidence/` holds files, that `.afk/t1-1/review-verdict.md` exists with `Compliance`, `Quality` and `QA` lines, and that the session never asked a question in the terminal.
  5. Also check that nothing was pushed and no PR was opened, and that `.afk/t1-1/decisions.md` records the choices it made.
  Until this is done, do not treat T0.2 as proven end to end.

### What was built, and why

- **`afk plan check` (A2, A3, A17, A26).** A new package `internal/plancheck` (`internal/state` stays read-only). The agent whose result settles a task runs `done` as its last command (the verifier on PASS when one runs, else the task agent); a workflow script cannot run commands, so no bookkeeping agent exists. The conductor marks `failed` and blocked tasks from the run's result and reconciles `passed`. A failed line keeps its title (`- [!] (ID) title FAILED: reason`), needs a one-line reason, and `done` over it restores the title. `failed` on a task already `[!]` does nothing, so a re-run cannot replace the real reason or duplicate the issues entry.
- **QA scenarios and file references (A4, A21, A22).** `plan_to_args.rb` rejects a task without them; the Go parser stays lenient so the dashboard still shows a plan the engine would reject. Scenarios are read line by line, not from the joined value. A directory may be listed with a trailing `/` beside at least one exact file.
- **Three checks (A5, A6, A20, A25).** Compliance (which now includes scope), quality, and hands-on QA. A critic runs only on a check with a blocker or major finding, sees only those findings, returns the surviving subset and never adds one. The script computes every verdict from the final findings. Go, the dashboard, goldens, fixtures and prose changed together.
- **Deleted scope prompt (A18).** `check-scope-fidelity.md` was removed in the same wave as the line that injects it, so the size check never saw a missing file.
- **Marking rules (A19).** An agent marks `done` only under the script's own pass condition, never from a fix prompt, so a crash cannot leave a false `[x]`.
- **Size cap (A7, A12).** `autonomous.md` kept its title and §7.1 to §7.5 numbering (a new §7.6 was added). Planner additions live in `planner/prompts/project-docs.md`. `check-cat-sizes.sh` and a Ruby test (`plugins/afk/scripts/test/plan_to_args_test.rb`) joined `make plugin-test`, with an explicit Ruby step in CI.
- **Autonomous policy without an inbox (A8).** Rules 2, 5 and 6 of PLAN §5.5 record to `.afk/{session}/decisions.md`. Rule 3 parks with the schema's existing `awaiting_input` write, a toast and a plain statement of what you must do, then ends the turn. T1.2 adds `afk inbox add` and must replace this in the prompt.
- **Stop before shipping (A9, A24).** Autonomous mode commits and writes `phase: done`, with no push and no PR; at the cap it commits and writes `failed`. Default mode keeps its draft PR. Ship instructions in the session description run after the commit and before the `done` write, because `done` is terminal.
- **Rate-limit marker (A10).** `.afk/{session}/.rate-limited`, written by the `StopFailure` hook and cleared by the next prompt or a normal stop. It mirrors the `.background-tasks` sidecar.
- **Planner documents (A11).** The planner writes glossary terms to `CONTEXT.md` and the task's entry in `docs/decisions.md`; the conductor amends the master-plan entry before the final commit.
- **Version (A13).** Both plugin manifests are 4.0.0, since old-format plans are now rejected.
- **Tests and prerequisites (A15, A16).** Tests were written with each change, red first where a test pinned the old behaviour. No prerequisites were missing.
- **Planning process (A27).** The work plan went through three review passes; the one critical finding left in pass 3 was fixed, so none remained open.

### Accepted risks

- A task agent ticks its checkbox just before its result reaches the script, so a crash in that instant can leave a `[x]` the script never confirmed. The conductor's reconcile step corrects it when the run returns; nothing corrects it if the run never returns.
- Two hook behaviours cannot be checked offline and are for T2.4 to confirm against a real limit: that a normal `Stop` does not also fire on a rate-limited turn (it would clear the marker at once), and that `StopFailure` fires when the agent CLI waits out a limit by itself.
- A verdict file written before this change, with a `- Scope:` line, shows as a parse error in the dashboard.

### Things a later task should know

- **OpenCode lags.** `plugins/afk-opencode` still has the old checks, the bookkeeping agent, six-subsection plans and the old autonomous prompt. `PROVENANCE.md` records it; the resync is deferred (PLAN §9).
- **A title containing `FAILED:` cannot round-trip** through `afk plan check`, because the line has no escaping and the parser splits at the first `FAILED:`.
- **The Go plan parser ignores code fences; `plan_to_args.rb` does not.** A task line at column 0 inside a fence counts as a task to the dashboard. `afk plan check` follows the Ruby reading.
- **`[policy] notes` (A8 context).** Until T1.1's loader exists, the agent reads `afk.toml` itself. The notes win over autonomous rules 2 to 6 only, never over rule 1, the schema, the gates or the cap.
- **Master-plan amendment** runs in both modes whenever the description names a master-plan task, and is skipped when the work is not approved.
- **Size headroom.** `conductor/SKILL.md` ends near 27,976 of 28,000 characters and `planner/SKILL.md` near 27,940; expect to trim before adding to either.
- **Known leftovers.** The fix agent may still flip a checkbox by hand in `conductor/SKILL.md`, and `go/SKILL.md` line 73 says the conductor opens a draft PR without qualifying it as default mode.

## T0.3

T0.3 closed two gaps against shipit (failure scenarios, exploratory QA) and fixed two defects T0.2's review reported (the critic could add findings, the Go plan parser read task lines inside code fences). These are the decisions the master plan left open, numbered as in the work plan's assumptions.

### What was decided, and why

- **How the critic's findings are matched (A1, A2).** Findings have no id, and the critic is allowed to correct a task ID, so matching on text would drop a finding the critic legitimately refiled. The review script now numbers the findings it hands the critic and the critic returns the number with each one it keeps. From a kept finding the script takes the original text, the critic's task ID if it gives one, and the lower of the two severities. A finding with an unknown, missing or repeated number is dropped. So the critic can confirm, downgrade, refile or reject, and nothing else.
- **`Case` rules (A3).** Every scenario needs `Case`, and it must be exactly `happy` or `failure`. A task always needs one `happy` scenario. The waiver is its own line, `No failure case: {reason}`, inside the task's QA Scenarios, and the reason cannot be empty. Errors about a single field are reported before errors about coverage.
- **A failure scenario and a waiver together (A4)** are accepted. It is redundant, not wrong, and rejecting it would fail a whole unattended session for nothing.
- **The Go parser (A5)** reads `Case` as free text and stores the waiver's reason on the task. It checks neither, so the dashboard still shows a plan the engine would reject. It has to recognise the waiver line, or the line would be read as more of the last scenario's evidence path.
- **Code fences in the Go parser (A6).** A fence now hides everything inside it: task lines, wave headings and section headings. A new task no longer resets the fence state. An unclosed fence hides the rest of the file. This is how `afk plan check` and `plan_to_args.rb` already read a plan, so all three agree.
- **Version (A7).** Both plugin manifests are 5.0.0, because a plan written for 4.0.0 (no `Case`) is now rejected.
- **Where the planner text went (A8).** `planner/SKILL.md` had 60 characters of room, so the rule lives in `plan-format.md` and the skill file only gained the template line and table wording, paid for by trimming.
- **This task's own work plan (A9)** uses `Case` on every scenario and no waiver line. The plugin that ran this session was the installed 4.0.0 copy, whose parser tolerates `Case` but would have rejected a waiver line.
- **Shipping (A10).** The session description asked to push, open a draft PR, mark it ready, wait for CI and merge on green. The conductor did that as written. The ship prompt says never to mark a PR ready, but that guards against doing it unasked, and the master plan's bootstrap section prescribes this exact instruction.
- **`make install` (A11)** is run by the conductor after the review approves, never by a task agent, because `~/bin/afk` is shared by every worktree.
- **Tests and prerequisites (A12, A13).** Tests were written with each change, red first. Nothing had to be in place before the work started.

### Things a later task should know

- **OpenCode lags further.** `plugins/afk-opencode` has no `Case` field, no failure-scenario rule, no exploratory QA and no guard on the critic. `PROVENANCE.md` records it.
- **An old work plan is rejected.** A plan under `.afk/plans/` written before this change has no `Case` lines; `plan_to_args.rb` refuses it and says which task and field.

### Decided while building

- **A fence also hides a title.** The Go parser checks for a fence before it looks for the plan's `# ` title, not only before sections, waves and tasks. A plan whose only title is inside a fence now fails with "missing its top-level title". Fences are tracked outside the Waves section too.
- **The waiver line is matched loosely.** Both parsers accept it with or without a leading `- `, in any letter case, and the last one wins if a task has several. In `plan_to_args.rb` an empty reason is an error even when the task also has a failure scenario. In Go a waiver before the first scenario is still read, and a wrapped second line of the reason is dropped.
- **The two waiver patterns must stay the same.** The Go pattern and `QA_WAIVER_LINE` in `plan_to_args.rb` were written to match; change one, change the other.
- **A fence inside a wrapped value.** A fenced line used to end a wrapped `**Files**` or `**Depends on**` value in the Go parser. It is now skipped, so the value stays open across the fence. No real plan does this and it is not tested either way.
- **The critic's reply.** A number that is not a whole number, or an empty entry, is dropped like an unknown number. A severity the script does not recognise keeps the original.
- **The hands-on QA prompt** now has four duties in order: build fresh and run from a clean state, run every scenario including the failure ones, explore (tasks together, then edge cases), and run the full suite once.
- **The worked example in `plan-format.md`** uses the waiver on its tests-only task and gives every other task a failure scenario.

### The supervised run (owed from T0.2)

This session was the first task run with afk's own plugin: `afk new --autonomous` with the T0.3 description, started on 2026-10-11 and left alone.

- **It asked nothing at the terminal.** Planning recorded 13 assumptions, one of them marked as a decision that would normally have gone to the owner (how to ship).
- **Evidence was saved.** Thirteen scenario evidence files under `.afk/t0-3/evidence/`, plus the QA check's own under `evidence/qa/`.
- **A verdict file was written**: APPROVE, with `Compliance`, `Quality` and `QA` all PASS and four minor findings. No critic ran, because no check reported a blocker or major finding.
- **Execution took one run**: six tasks, all passed first time, eleven agents.
- **One checkbox mark was missed.** The run reported W1.T2 as passed but its line was still unticked. The conductor's reconcile step ticked it with `afk plan check`, which is what that step is for.
- **The known flaky test failed once.** `TestHostLifecycleEndToEnd` in `internal/host` failed in the QA check's first full run and passed when run again. This change does not touch that package (see `## T0.1`).
- **What this run did not prove.** It ran on the installed 4.0.0 plugin, so the new rules were covered by tests and a scratch-plan check against a freshly built binary, not by a whole session. The first session started after `afk plugin install` will be the first to plan with `Case` fields, run the exploratory QA prompt and use the guarded critic.

### Not verified, owner check

- **Install the new plugin.** `make install` updates the binary only. Run `afk plugin install --target claude` (and any other target you use) so new sessions get plugin 5.0.0. The conductor did not run it, because it changes your agent CLI's configuration and would swap the plugin under the running session.
- **Watch the next session's QA check.** Confirm that it starts from a fresh build, runs the failure scenarios, and saves an evidence file for anything it reports from the exploratory step.

## T0.4

T0.4 fixes the flaky `TestHostLifecycleEndToEnd`. These are the decisions the master plan left open, numbered as in the work plan's assumptions.

### What was decided, and why

- **Cause before fix (A1).** The first task reproduces the failure and proves the cause with a run. Nothing is fixed from reading the code alone. The fix follows the written diagnosis, wherever it points.
- **Shape of the fix (A2).** The expected fault is in the attach client: it sends the detach message and only afterwards notes that the user asked to detach, so the host's close can be read first and reported as a dropped connection. The fix notes the user's intent first. The host still closes the connection on a detach, and the message format does not change.
- **How it is pinned (A3, A8).** A test forces the bad ordering on purpose instead of waiting for it to happen. It is written first and must fail on the old code.
- **The dashboard pane is in scope (A4).** It sends the detach message and records the reason in the same order as `afk attach`. It gets the same test and, if the test shows the wrong reason, the same fix.
- **Load and long runs (A5).** CPU load comes from shell busy loops, two per CPU, because no stress tool is installed. The 500 and 200 runs are split into batches of 100 so no command runs longer than about four minutes.
- **Which notes go (A6).** The T0.1 bullet in this file and the clause in T0.1's amendment in `docs/PLAN.md` are removed. The line under `## T0.3` about the test failing once stays, as a record of that run. `CLAUDE.md` never had a note about this test.
- **Shipping (A7).** As the session description asks: push, open a draft PR, mark it ready, wait for CI and merge on green, with a merge commit. This would normally have gone to the owner; the master plan's bootstrap section prescribes it.
- **Prerequisites (A9).** Nothing had to be in place before the work started.

### The cause

- **What happened, step by step.** When you press ctrl+\ to detach, the client sends the host a detach message, and only after that write returns does it write down "the user asked to leave". The host answers the detach message by closing the connection with nothing in front of the close, which is how a client tells "detached" from "the session ended". Two goroutines then race: the one reading from the host sees the close and records "connection dropped", and the one that sent the detach records "detached by the user". Only the first is kept. Most of the time the sender wins; sometimes the host's close is read first.
- **Where the fault was.** In the client side of the connection, not the host and not the test. It was proven by runs: 95 failures in 650 runs of the test on the unchanged code; a 20ms pause between the send and the record failed 20 of 20; recording before sending failed 0 of 300 with the host untouched. There were two copies of the fault: the attach client in `internal/host/client.go`, and the dashboard's pane (`hostChild.Close` and `Read`) in `internal/ui/hostpane.go`.
- **Could a user have hit it?** Yes, through `afk attach`. It goes through the pane code, not `host.Attach` (which nothing in afk calls). Pressing ctrl+\ could print `afk attach: connection dropped` and exit with code 13 instead of exiting 0. Measured on the shipped code against a real host: 10 wrong in 2000 detaches, about 0.5%. The session was never harmed and kept running. The dashboard stored the same wrong reason but never showed it, because closing a pane clears it and the late message is ignored.
- **What the fix does.** Both places now check whether the user asked to leave when they read the close. The attach client sets a flag just before each detach send (ctrl+\ and end of input), and its reader reports "detached" when the flag is set. The pane's `Read` consults the `closed` flag that `Close` already set before writing the detach. A close with no such request is still reported as a drop, and a `Stolen` or `Exit` frame that arrives first still wins. The host and the message format are unchanged.
- **Tests that pin it.** `TestAttachDetachIsNotReportedAsDropped` in `internal/host/client_test.go` (rows for ctrl+\, end of input, and a control row where no detach was asked for, which must still read as dropped) and `TestHostChildDetachReason` in `internal/ui/hostpane_test.go`. Both force the bad ordering with a wrapped connection instead of waiting for it, were red on the old code and are green on the new. `TestHostChildWriteFrameTimesOutInsteadOfBlockingForever` also asserts that a failed live write still reads as a drop. `TestHostLifecycleEndToEnd` itself is unchanged.

### Decided while building

- **The fix is in the readers, not in the order of statements.** Reporting "detached" before sending would let `attach` return and close the connection while the detach message was still unsent. For the pane, moving the exit mark ahead of the write would also tell `Wait` the connection had ended too early. A recorded intent that the reader consults avoids both.
- **A flag, not a lock.** The attach client uses one atomic boolean because it has one writer and one reader.
- **A failed detach write reads as "detached".** The user asked to leave, so that is the true answer; the session keeps running either way. A failed write of ordinary typed input still reads as a drop.
- **A `Stolen` or `Exit` frame wins over a close the user just asked for,** because it is true and more useful.
- **Forcing the ordering needs two waits in the client test.** Waiting for the read error is not enough, since a gap remains before the reader reports; the wrapper also waits for the connection to be closed by the client's teardown. The wrapper counts how often it forced the ordering and the detach rows assert it did.
- **A detach within about 25ms of attaching hides the race,** because the host is still busy with its attach-time resize. A test must force the ordering.
- **Not verified against a built binary.** It needs a terminal and a live agent session. The owner's check is: attach, press ctrl+\, expect `detached` and exit code 0.
- **Known gaps.** No test drives `ui.AttachPane` to a user detach against a real host. The cross-process rate is unmeasured.
- **README unchanged.** It already describes ctrl+\ as exit 0 and code 13 as a drop; the fix makes the behaviour match.

## T1.3

T1.3 adds the usage probe, the governor's decision and the `afk usage` command. These are the decisions the master plan left open, numbered as in the work plan's assumptions.

### What was decided, and why

- **The `Usage` method takes its runner (A1).** The master plan shows `Usage(ctx)`. It is built as `Usage(ctx, UsageDeps)`, where `UsageDeps` holds the function that runs the CLI and the clock. Every other provider call that reaches outside takes its runner the same way, and it is what lets the tests run without any agent CLI installed.
- **What a window carries (A2).** Besides its kind, percentage and reset time, a window has a `scope`: the model's name on a per-model weekly row. The CLI's `weekly_all` becomes `weekly` and `weekly_scoped` becomes `weekly_model`. A kind afk does not know is kept as `unknown` with the CLI's own word in `scope`, because dropping it could hide a limit.
- **Odd or missing data (A3).** No report in the stream, empty limits, or no readable row all mean "no usage report", which is an error and not a snapshot. A row without a numeric percentage is skipped. Percentages are read as 0 to 100 and never guessed to be fractions. A reset time can be ISO text or epoch seconds; one that cannot be read is left unknown and the row is kept. A missing extra-usage block reads as off.
- **Where the decision lives (A4).** A new package, `internal/governor`, with one pure function. Its answer is one of `run`, `no_launch`, `pause`, `hold` or `refuse`, with a plain reason, the window that caused it and, for a pause, when to wake.
- **Order of the rules (A5).** "This provider cannot report usage" is checked first, although the master plan's table lists it last: such a provider never has a snapshot, so "no snapshot" would always win otherwise. In the launch rule "weekly" means both the all-models and the per-model weekly windows. An unknown window can pause but cannot stop launches by itself. When several windows are over the pause line, the wake time is the latest reset plus one minute. A snapshot exactly 30 minutes old counts as stale. A setting for unknown usage that afk does not recognise holds.
- **Thresholds are in code for now (A6).** 90% to pause, 75% to stop launching, 30 minutes for stale, 5 minutes between probes, and "run" when usage is unknown. There are no config keys yet: machine config is a JSON file with three unrelated keys, and T2.4, which puts the governor in the daemon, is the place to add them.
- **The snapshot file (A7).** `internal/usagestate` writes `usage.json` under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/afk/` when that is set, otherwise `~/.local/state/afk/`. It has the fields of PLAN §4.5 plus `scope` on a window. `source` is `probe`. The governor's action is not stored yet; T2.4 owns that. A missing or broken file reads as "no snapshot".
- **When `afk usage` probes (A8).** It reuses a stored snapshot younger than 5 minutes and probes otherwise; `--refresh` forces a probe. It exits 0 when it printed a report (including "usage unknown" for a provider with no probe), 1 when the probe or the write failed, and 2 for a bad flag or provider name.
- **Where the probe runs (A9).** In afk's state directory, not the directory you ran `afk usage` from. The agent CLI keeps a record of every run under the directory it started in, and a probe every few minutes would fill whatever project that was.
- **The fixture and the throttling question (A10).** The captured stream is committed with ids zeroed, the start-up line cut to a few harmless keys, and the readable usage text removed. The probe was run three times in a row to see whether limits ever come back empty. Nobody tried to find the point where it gets throttled, because tripping a rate limit on the owner's account on purpose is not a machine's call.
- **Tests and prerequisites (A11, A12).** Tests were written with each change. Nothing had to be in place before the work started.
- **Shipping (A13).** As the session description asks: push, open a draft PR, mark it ready, wait for CI and merge on green. The conductor runs `make install` after the review approves.

### The spike

- The probe was run against Claude Code 2.1.296: `claude -p "/usage" --output-format stream-json --verbose`.
- It was run three times back to back. Each run exited 0, printed three JSON lines and contained a `usage_report` whose `rate_limits` was a full object. No throttling showed up. Nobody tried to cause it.
- With `--output-format json` the output is a single result object with no `usage_report`; the text is only in its `result` field, as PLAN §6.2 says.
- What differs from §6.2: nothing that changes the plan. The `limits[]` rows carry more keys than the plan named (`group`, `scope`, `severity`, `is_active`), the model name is under `scope.model.display_name`, and `extra_usage` has a few more keys than `is_enabled`. The probe should run outside a project directory.
- The committed fixture is the first run, with ids zeroed and the readable text removed.

### Decided while building

- **A reading that parses wins over the exit status.** If the CLI exits non-zero but its output holds a usable report, the report is used.
- **The first report in the stream is final.** If its limits are unusable the result is "no usage report"; later lines are not tried.
- **Percentages are checked by type.** A `null` percentage would decode as 0, so the parser rejects it and skips the row. A reset time given as epoch seconds is accepted only below 1e12 (larger is probably milliseconds); otherwise the time is left unknown and the row is kept.
- **A wrong-typed extra-usage block reads as off.**
- **Several windows over a line.** The highest-used one is reported, and ties keep the first. When a pause has a window with no known reset time, the wake time is left empty and the caller must treat that as "no known wake time".
- **Reasons round to one decimal** so 89.9% never reads as 90% next to a "not starting" verdict. A zero stale limit makes every reading stale; callers pass the default thresholds.
- **`usage.json` ignores a relative `XDG_STATE_HOME`**, as the XDG spec requires. The state package takes the provider name as a string, so nothing outside `internal/provider` names one.
- **A reading is reused only if it is in the past.** One stamped in the future (the clock moved back) is not reused; the command probes. A stored reading from a different provider is ignored.
- **A reused reading is never "just now".** It prints "less than a minute ago" so the second run is told apart from a live probe.
- **If the probe fails** and an earlier reading exists, that reading is printed with the error and the exit code is 1. With none, it prints "No usage reading is available." and the governor says `hold`.
- **A pause with no known reset prints "There is no known wake time."** on the Governor line.
- **`afk usage help`** prints the help and exits 0, like `plan help`; any other extra word is exit 2.

### Not verified, owner check

- **Another timing failure in the host tests.** In the review's one full run, `TestServeSIGTERMBehavesLikeExit` in `internal/host` failed with "connection reset by peer". It passed when run again alone, and a second full `make check` was green. This change does not touch that package. It is not the test T0.4 fixed, so it may need its own look.
- **How often it is safe to probe is still unknown.** Three probes in a row were fine. Nothing here shows what happens when the request behind it is throttled; the parser treats empty limits as "no reading" and the governor then holds once the last reading is 30 minutes old.

### Ideas left out

- The agent CLI may have a flag that stops a one-shot run from saving a session record. If it does, the probe could use it and would not need its own working directory. Not looked into.
- `afk usage` has no machine-readable output. The dashboard and web page are meant to read `usage.json` instead.
